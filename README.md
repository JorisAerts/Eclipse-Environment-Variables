# Eclipse Environment Variables
Allows you to define global environment variables to eclipse. You can use these variables, for example, instead of the Variables tab on JUnit Configurations.

_Tested on Eclipse 4.4 to 4.10


### Installation
Download the jar from the [latest release](https://github.com/JorisAerts/Eclipse-Environment-Variables/releases/latest) and drop it in eclipse's "dropins" folder. Restart eclipse. 

You'll now see an _Environment Variables_ page in the _General_ section of eclipse's Preferences.
