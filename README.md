# Eclipse Environment Variables

![maven-ci](https://github.com/JorisAerts/Eclipse-Environment-Variables/workflows/maven-ci/badge.svg) 

Allows you to define global environment variables to eclipse. You can use these variables, for example, instead of the Variables tab on JUnit Configurations.

_Tested on Eclipse 4.4 to 4.17_
